**Multi-view broad learning systerm (MVBLS)** [1] is a multi-view  framework that bases on BLS [2]. It is designed to be efficient with the following advantages:

- Support of classification and regression in supervised multi-view or multi-modal learning.
- Support of classification and regression in semi-supervised multi-view or multi-modal learning [3].
- Support of two or more views or modals.
