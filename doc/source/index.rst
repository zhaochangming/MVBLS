**Multi-view broad learning systerm (MVBLS)** [1] is a multi-view or multi-modal framework that bases on BLS [2]. It is designed to be efficient with the following advantages:


- Support of classification and regression in supervised learning.
- Support of classification and regression in semi-supervised learning [3].
- Support of two or more views or modals.
